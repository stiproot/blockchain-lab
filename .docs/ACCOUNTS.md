In Solana, an account is a fundamental building block used to store data and program state on-chain. 
Unlike other blockchains where smart contracts manage their own storage, Solana programs interact with accounts to read and write data.

## Key Characteristics of an Account in Solana
1. Owned by a Program:
    - An account can be owned by a program (smart contract) or by a user (signer).
    - Only the owning program can modify an account's data.
2. Stores Data:
    - Accounts store binary data (structured using formats like Borsh or raw bytes).
    - Each account has a fixed amount of allocated space.
3. Holds Lamports (SOL):
    - Every account has a balance of lamports (Solana’s smallest unit, like wei in Ethereum).
    - This balance is used for rent (storage costs), unless the account is rent-exempt (has enough SOL to cover rent indefinitely).
4. Account Types:
    - User (Signer) Accounts: Created and controlled by users with private keys.
    - Program (Executable) Accounts: Contain compiled BPF bytecode and are marked as executable.
    - State (Data) Accounts: Hold custom data, usually managed by a program.

## How Solana Programs Use Accounts
Since Solana programs (smart contracts) are stateless, they do not store persistent state like a traditional database.
Instead, they operate on accounts that hold the actual data.

For example, an NFT minting program might have:
- Mint Account → Stores details about the NFT (e.g., supply, metadata address).
- Token Account → Stores the NFT ownership for a specific user.
- Metadata Account → Stores additional metadata like name, symbol, URI.
