A `Smart Contract` can be both:
1. An Application (Executable Code) – It contains logic that runs on the blockchain, enabling decentralized applications (DApps) to execute functions like transferring tokens, enforcing rules, and automating processes.
2. A Static File (Immutable Data) – Some smart contracts store static data, such as NFT metadata, which remains unchanged after deployment.

# Invoking a Smart Contract
A Solana smart contract (also called a program) written in Rust can receive data from a client, such as a web API. 
However, there are a few important details to consider:

1. **Interaction via Transactions**:
    - Solana programs do not run on their own; they execute in response to transactions submitted by clients. These transactions include instructions that contain the data being sent.
2. **Client to Program Communication**:
    - A web API (e.g., a Node.js or Python backend) can use a Solana SDK (like `@solana/web3.js` in JavaScript or `solana-py` in Python) to create and send transactions.
    - The transaction includes accounts and instruction data that the smart contract will process.
3. **Instruction Data Format**:
    - The data must be serialized before being sent in the transaction. Common serialization formats include:
        - Borsh (commonly used in Solana)
        - JSON (less common, since Solana prefers binary formats for efficiency)
4. **Processing in Rust**:
    - In your Solana Rust program, you will:
        - Deserialize the incoming data from the transaction’s instruction data.
        - Perform any logic required (e.g., updating accounts, validating data).
        - Optionally, modify Solana accounts (since programs cannot store state internally).

*Example Flow:*
A web API collects user input (e.g., a mint request for an NFT).
The API constructs a Solana transaction with an instruction.
The transaction is signed and submitted to the blockchain.
The Solana program executes and processes the data.
