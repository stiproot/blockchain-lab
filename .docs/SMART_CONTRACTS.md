A `Smart Contract` can be both:
1. An Application (Executable Code) – It contains logic that runs on the blockchain, enabling decentralized applications (DApps) to execute functions like transferring tokens, enforcing rules, and automating processes.
2. A Static File (Immutable Data) – Some smart contracts store static data, such as NFT metadata, which remains unchanged after deployment.
