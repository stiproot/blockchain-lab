- An **SPL token program** refers to a set of instructions on the Solana blockchain, part of the **Solana Program Library (SPL)**, that defines the standard for creating and managing both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana network, essentially allowing developers to easily create their own tokens with specific attributes like name, symbol, and maximum supply on the Solana platform; similar to how ERC-20 works on Ethereum.
