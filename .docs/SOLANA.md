Any transaction on the Solana blockchain requires a keypair or wallet. 
If you are connecting to a wallet, you do not need to worry about the keypair. 
Otherwise a keypair must be generated for signing transactions.

Every Account on Solana has the following fields:
- `data`: A byte array that stores arbitrary data for an account. For non-executable accounts, this generally stores state that is meant to be read-only. For program accounts (smart contracts), this contains the executable program code. The data field is commonly referred to as "account data".
- `executable`: A boolean flag that indicates if the account is a program.
- `lamports`: The account's balance in lamports, the smallest unit of SOL (1 SOL = 1 billion lamports).
- `owner`: The program ID (public key) of the program that owns this account. Only the owner program can modify the account's data or deduct its lamports balance.
- `rent_epoch`: A legacy field from when Solana had a mechanism that periodically deducted lamports from accounts. While this field still exists in the Account type, it is no longer used since rent collection was deprecated.

# Wallet
A Solana wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to store, send, receive, and interact with Solana (SOL) and SPL tokens (Solana's token standard).
It also enables you to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana blockchain.

## Types of Solana Wallets
- Web Wallets – Browser-based wallets like Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack that offer an easy-to-use interface.
- Mobile Wallets – Wallets like Phantom and Solflare also have mobile apps for iOS and Android.
- CLI Wallets – Command-line wallets, such as Solana CLI, for developers and advanced users.
- Hardware Wallets – Ledger Nano S/X and Trezor provide cold storage for extra security.
- Paper Wallets – A printed version of your private key for offline storage.
